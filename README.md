# NABDH Frontend Prototype

This is a minimal React (Vite) prototype implementing the NABDH Doctor Portal V1 UI as a static frontend. It follows the `NABDH'S UI.pdf` design principles (Arabic-first, doctor-speed focused, simple recorder + SOAP builder + Insurance assistant).

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\mednabdh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:5173` by default (Vite). The UI is static and does not include backend integration.

Next steps:
- Review the pages and component structure in `src/`.
- I can now integrate the backend API routes or add more detailed styling and test data if you want.
