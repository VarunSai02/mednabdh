NABDH Vision 

The GCC Grade Clinical AI Layer for Outpatient Doctors, Clinics, and Hospitals 

Why NABDH Exists 

Clinicians in the GCC face heavy documentation workload, fragmented workﬂows, and 
complex insurance processes. Arabic capable AI tools are limited and not aligned with GCC 
clinical practice or regulation. 

NABDH exists to become the clinical AI layer for outpatient care in the GCC, reducing 
documentation time, improving safety, and streamlining insurance workﬂows for doctors, 
clinics, and hospitals. 

What NABDH Is 

NABDH is an Arabic native, GCC grade Clinical AI platform for doctors and clinical staff. 

It integrates directly into outpatient workﬂows to provide: 

●  AI-assisted documentation 
●  Clinical summaries and safety checks 
● 
Insurance automation and justiﬁcation 
●  Regulatory aligned logging and oversight 

It is built for clinicians and staff, not for patients. 

The Core Problem NABDH Solves 

1.  Clinician overload 

Doctors spend a large portion of each visit documenting instead of treating. 

2.  Documentation and workﬂow friction 

Notes, summaries, referrals, and insurance documentation are manual and 
inconsistent. 
3.  Arabic AI gap 

4. 

Existing tools are not optimized for GCC Arabic, clinical structure, or local practice. 
Insurance process complexity 
Eligibility, pre-auth, and claims require tedious, error-prone documentation that leads 
to rejections and revenue loss. 

NABDH solves this by being the AI assistant inside the clinic workﬂow focused only on 
doctors and staff. 

 
 
 Why NABDH Wins (Differentiators) 

1.  Arabic Native Clinical AI Engine 

Built for GCC dialects and Arabic medical language, with structured clinical notes, 
summaries, red-ﬂag detection, and hallucination protection. 

2.  GCC Aligned Clinical Workﬂows 

Outpatient workﬂows, specialties, documentation patterns, and safety rules modeled on 
DHA/DOH/MOHAP expectations and regional practice. 

3. Insurance Automation for GCC 

Eligibility support, pre-auth justiﬁcation, claim draft generation, and rejection risk prediction 
based on doctor-approved notes and pathways. 

4.  Regulatory Ready Architecture 

UAE data residency, consent, audit logging, AI disclosure, role-based access, and full 
traceability of AI outputs for pilots and regulatory review. 

5.  Acquisition Ready Design 

Modular architecture, clear interfaces, structured data, and evidence from real pilots make 
NABDH attractive to EMR vendors, insurers, hospital groups, and digital health platforms. 

Version 1 Scope (Dec 2025 – May 2026) 

Strictly focused on clinicians and staff. No patient app. 

1. Doctor / Staff Portal – V1 

●  AI consultation recorder (Arabic speech to text) 
●  Structured SOAP/clinical notes 
●  Clinical summaries for doctors and records 
●  Medication & safety checks (drug interactions, red ﬂags) 
●  Referral & specialty routing support 
● 

Integration hooks for EMR/clinic systems (where applicable) 

2. Arabic Clinical AI Engine – V1 

●  GCC Arabic ASR 
●  Clinical structuring & summarization 
●  Red-ﬂag & pathway based safety logic 

 
 
● 

Insurance oriented clinical justiﬁcation generation 

3. Insurance Automation Module – V1 

●  Eligibility support 
●  Pre-authorization builder (clinical justiﬁcation draft) 
●  Claim draft builder (structure + narrative) 
●  Rejection risk predictor (V1 rules + patterns) 

4. Compliance & Safety Layer – V1 

●  Consent ﬂows for AI usage 
●  Audit logs for all AI actions and edits 
●  Red-ﬂag and clinical pathways governance 
●  AI usage disclosure and safety rules 
●  UAE data residency and encryption 

Success by May 2026 

NABDH is considered successful if, by May 2026: 

1.  Pilot #1 and Pilot #2 are completed in real clinics/hospitals with positive feedback from 

doctors and management. 

2.  Doctors achieve 30–50% reduction in documentation time during consultations. 
Insurance workﬂows show measurable improvement (fewer rejections, faster 
3. 
approvals, clearer justiﬁcations). 

4.  Clinical governance (via Dr. Ahmed) and regulatory oversight (via regulatory advisor) 

sign off on safety and compliance. 

5.  The platform is 70% feature complete and technically stable, ready for scaling. 
6.  An acquisition ready package (documentation, metrics, architecture, safety model, 

pilot results) is prepared. 

7.  3–5 strategic buyers (EMR vendors, insurers, hospital groups, digital platforms) are in 

active discussions. 

Final Vision Line 

NABDH will become the trusted Arabic native clinical AI layer for GCC outpatient care 
supporting doctors, clinics, and hospitals with safe, fast, and intelligent AI across 
documentation, safety, and insurance workﬂows.
