NABDH: MVP Scope Document 

Version: 1.0 December 2025 

Prepared by: Founder

1. MVP Summary (What we are building in 
the next 6 months) 

NABDH MVP = the GCC’s first Arabic native Clinical AI Layer for doctors, built on: 

●  Doctor Portal V1 
●  Arabic Clinical AI Engine (audio → transcript → SOAP → summary) 
●  Safety & Clinical Pathways Engine 
● 
●  Compliance Layer (logging, consent, UAE data residency) 
●  Pilot #1 (Dec–Jan) + Pilot #2 (Feb–Mar) 
●  Acquisition readiness by April–May 2026 

Insurance Assistant V1 (pre-auth + claim narratives) 

This MVP is NOT: 

●  A patient app 
●  A full EMR 
●  A diagnostic engine 

This MVP is laser focused on doctor efficiency, Arabic AI, and insurance automation, which 
gives us maximum traction with minimum build cost. 

2. MVP Goals (What must be delivered 
100%) 

By March 2026, NABDH MVP must deliver: 

 
 
2.1 Core AI Functionality 

●  Arabic speech to text (ASR) 
●  Transcript → structured SOAP note 
●  Structured note → doctor summary 
●  Red flag safety checks 
●  Clinical pathways for top 5–6 complaints 

2.2 Doctor Portal V1 

●  Login 
●  Dashboard 
●  Audio recorder 
●  Visit notes (AI generated) 
●  Edit notes 
●  Safety alerts 
●  Simple past history view 

2.3 Insurance Assistant V1 

●  Pre-auth justification drafts 
●  Claim narrative drafts 
●  Missing-item checklist 
●  Rejection risk (rule-based) 

2.4 Compliance & Safety 

●  Consent screen 
●  Privacy disclosure 
●  Audit logs 
●  UAE data residency 
●  Safety stop conditions 

2.5 Pilots 

●  Pilot #1: Base44 CAIC (Dec–Jan) 
●  Pilot #2: NABDH V1 (Feb–Mar) 

2.6 Acquisition Preparation (April–May) 

●  Final demo 
●  Pilot report (1 + 2) 

●  Safety + validation report 
●  Buyer pipeline 
●  LOIs 

3. Lean Architecture (Azure UAE + Local 
Model) 

3.1 Infrastructure 

Cloud: Azure UAE Region 

Why: 

●  Complies with UAE healthcare data residency 
●  Used by Malaffi/M42 
●  Low latency 
●  Best for future integrations 

Compute: 

●  1 small compute instance for backend 
●  1 GPU-backed instance for local inference during development only 
●  Limit GPU usage to: 
➝ model testing 
➝ summary generation 
➝ accuracy evaluation 

Storage: 

●  Azure Blob 
●  PostgreSQL 

3.2 AI Architecture 

LLM Model Strategy: 

 
 
 
●  Use a local Arabic clinical model (not external OpenAI/GPT) 
●  Smaller distilled model for: 

➝ cost control 
➝ privacy 
➝ UAE residency 

●  RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) optional for phase 2 

ASR Engine: 

●  Whisper Arabic (localized) 

or 

●  Azure Arabic Speech Service 

Pipeline: 

1.  Audio → ASR 
2.  ASR → transcript 
3.  Transcript → structured SOAP 
4.  SOAP → doctor summary 
5.  Safety layer checks 
6.  Save log 

3.3 Backend Architecture 

●  FastAPI or Django 
●  Microservice architecture (minimal) 
●  Logging service 
● 
●  Notes service 
●  Authentication 

Insurance service 

3.4 Frontend Architecture 

●  React + Next.js 
●  Doctor portal, responsive 
●  Simple + fast (not heavy UI) 

 
 
 
3.5 DevOps 

●  GitHub (repo + branches) 
●  GitHub Actions (CI/CD) 
●  Jira for sprint management
